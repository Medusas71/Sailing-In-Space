# Description  

I am currently studying the Full Stack Development Course through Code Institute. 
Part of the course I am required to complete 4 milestone projects. 
This website is my first milestone project which is part of the User Centric Frontend Module.

This website has been created for local Sunshine Coast Band - Sailing In Space. 
The purpose of this website is for the band to promote gigs, their music and 
merchandise to their fans.

## 5 Planes

<a id="strategy"></a>

showcases their talent to their fans and for a potential record deal.

The site owner goals of this website are:
  * To sell more music
  * To sell merchandise
  * To get more gigs which include functions and weddings
  * For fans to purchase tickets to upcoming gigs
  * To increase our social media following
  * To receive a record deal

The existing and potential fan goals of this website are:

  * To purchase their music
  * To attend gigs
  * To learn more about the band
  * To view photos and videos of the band
  * To purchase merchandise
  * To follow the band on social media
  * To book the band for functions and/or weddings

The record company goals of this website are:
 * To listen to their music
 * Find out if they already have a record deal
 * Contact the band

<a id="scope"></a>
### 2. Scope  

The features of this project will include:
  * The ability to listen to the bands music
  * The ability to purchase the bands music
  * The ability to purchase merchandise
  * The ability to learn more about the band
  * The ability to see what gigs they are playing at
  * The ability to show my interest to attend gigs
  * The ability to contact the band
  * The ability to contact the band for a potential booking
  * The ability to view photos and videos of the band
  * The ability to go straight to social media platforms from the website

<a id="structure"></a>
### 3. Structure  

The information is grouped logically for all customers. The Interaction Design (IXD) will be consistent
between pages where the navigation bar is fixed and tailored to have the priority items displayed first
at the top of the screen. All social media icons will be in the footer and the footer will be fixed so 
users can access these icons at all times. Once the 'Contact Us' content has been submitted, the user
will have clear feedback that the information has been submitted. The site will be consistent with what
users expect from a band website.

### 5. Surface  

Colour Scheme  
  * The main colours will be black #000000 for the background, white #FFFFFF for the text and blue #13A6DB for the Navigation bar, buttons and titles.
  These colours represent space.  

  Typography  
  * The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font.
  This font was chosen as it compliments the Titillium Web font that is used for the titles.  
  * The Titillium Web font was used for all headings with sans-serif as the fallback font.
  This font was chosen as it is a close font to Sailing In Spaces logo.  

  Imagery
  * All images, except the 404 error page, were sourced from Sailing In Space and include images of the band, merchandise and gigs.
