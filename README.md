### 3. Structure  

The information is grouped logically for all customers. The Interaction Design (IXD) will be consistent
between pages where the navigation bar is fixed and tailored to have the priority items displayed first
at the top of the screen. All social media icons will be in the footer and the footer will be fixed so 
users can access these icons at all times. Once the 'Contact Us' content has been submitted, the user
will have clear feedback that the information has been submitted. The site will be consistent with what
users expect from a band website.
