              <p class="sis-name">The name Sailing In space was originally formed when Dylan was in High school. 
                It was a play on the saying ‘you have your head in the clouds’ and Dylan was brainstorming 
                of what would be the most progressive version of that particular cliché.<span id="dots">....</span><span id="more">Space was what came to mind as it is above the clouds. And ‘sailing’ came along with the thought of an 
                action that involves going with the flow. Dylan was making music under the name, which 
                involved heavy electronic sounds and thumping beats. Later, in 2017 Dylan was living in 
                an apartment on the Gold Coast and I (Jesse) was wanting to start a musical project after 
                writing the song ‘Stubborn’ at our residence in Nambour Heights. And so we began.</span></p>

                      <p>Jesse started writing poems and music in High School and became inspired by both Dylan’s 
                        talent and music involvement when he was in high school. He came about singing due to his 
                        brother, Dylan, singing around the house. Jesse got singing lessons and piano lessons so 
                        he could improve and learn the art professionally. Eventually Jesse decided to pursue a 
                        solo career in music through school doing both covers and originals. With his writing 
                        capability he wrote numerous songs with Dylan for his music assignments, such as 
                        I Am Gallium (on Youtube) and many others. Jesse was happy with how Dylan managed to 
                        write and produce his songs and decided that in 2017, after writing with Dylan, he 
                        wanted to start a project with him. Then Sailing In Space started.</p>

                      <p>Dylan started playing drums at an early age and by 15 he was performing in front 
                        of audiences with his school band. He got his first taste of  playing shows locally 
                        while drumming for a  metalcore band called "We, The Relentless". After leaving school,  
                        Dylan was passionate about starting a music career and went straight into studying a 
                        diploma of music. He joined Electro Pop band "The Electro Kid" in 2013, who played many 
                        live shows and professionally recorded their E.P "Pixels" in Sydney. Dylan's drumming 
                        talents were recognised by other sunshine coast musicians and he was poached by members 
                        of "Malibu Stacy" in 2015. Dylan was fortunate enough to tour the east coast of Australia 
                        twice with Malibu Stacy before the band became inactive in 2017. All the while Dylan was 
                        producing and writing his own music, honing his songwriting skills and looking for a 
                        vocalist to take Sailing In Space to the stage. Midway through 2017 Dylan heard a song 
                        Jesse had written and decided that Jesse would be the 2nd member of Sailing In Space, 
                        taking the project to the next level.</p>
